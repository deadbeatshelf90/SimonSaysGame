            <p class="heading">Evaluation of the final artefact. </p>
            <p>
                In relation to the requirements set out by the brief I feel that my artefact has met all the basic and advanced requirements of the brief. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Micro-bit-based embedded system is entirely automated, utilizing buttons for digital inputs and the LED display for digital output. Additionally, it employs a heart rate monitor as an analog input and the built-in buzzer as the analog output. Collectively, these components create a beneficial distraction from the pressures of contemporary life, presenting users with a straightforward and concise game experience. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Each of the data points collected are validated to be either a string, integer or Boolean by the system before being stored on the cloud database called Firebase. This allows the artefact to not rely on storage for data which makes it more portable. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The main page of my website provides an analysis of the user's recent progress and helps inform them if they should take a break to avoid getting further stress from the game. All of this helps to support the user’s current and future wellbeing. 
            </p>
            <p>
                From the dataset I created by using the artefact myself I created I was able to answer the 2 what if questions by having the user’s current input guide the dataset to a more accurate prediction, thereby having a more efficient impact on their wellbeing. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For both 'what if' questions, I employed three parameters validated by the system as Boolean, integer, or string. Arrays or lists of integers or strings were assumed to maintain the same typing as their elements. The first question aids users in establishing their session target round, while the second question leverages user feedback to bolster and underscore conclusions derived from the analysis component. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, there are 2 graphs used by the analysis component to portray the progress of the user and the trend of their heartrate (and thereby their stress). This lets the user get a better understanding of what helps and damages their well-being. 
            </p>
            <p class="heading">How has my project met the needs of the end user? </p>
            <p>
                From my investigation I found that my end users are young teenagers that possess high reaction times. However, they also have found themselves stressed due to school and other social related sources, so they require a distraction from the likes of social media and schoolwork. This is why i feel that a game would be the best course of action to help them de-stress. 
            </p>
            <p class="heading">How could my artefact be improved? </p>
            <p>
                While I'm confident in my artifact's design, I recognize its hardware limitations. Upgrading the system with a stronger microprocessor, such as an Arduino, or creating a smartphone application could greatly enhance interactivity and immersion. This improvement would minimize input and processing delays, resulting in a more engaging and interactive game experience for users. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Another way to further enhance the scope and efficiency of the artefact would be monitor the user’s blood pressure to gain a more accurate reading of their stress as having multiple sources of data would ensure the analysis component will be as accurate as can be.
