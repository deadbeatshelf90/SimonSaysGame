<p class="heading">Physical Wellbeing:</p> 
<ol>
    <li>Exercise and Physical Activity: Engaging in regular exercise and physical activity is essential for maintaining physical health. It includes activities such as walking, jogging, swimming, and strength training.</li>
    <li>Nutrition and Diet: Consuming a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats is crucial for providing the body with essential nutrients and promoting overall health.</li>
    <li>Sleep Hygiene: Getting adequate and quality sleep is vital for physical wellbeing. Practicing good sleep hygiene, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule and creating a conducive sleep environment, is important for restorative sleep.</li>
</ol>

<p class="heading">Mental Wellbeing</p>
<ol>
    <li>Stress Management: Developing effective strategies for managing stress, such as mindfulness, relaxation techniques, and time management, is crucial for maintaining mental wellbeing.</li>
    <li>Self-care Practices: Engaging in self-care activities that promote relaxation, enjoyment, and personal fulfillment, such as hobbies, leisure activities, and self-reflection, is important for mental health maintenance.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    The areas I wish to focus on in this project are stress management and heartrate. <br>
    These are 2 very important areas for teenagers who may struggle with stress, anxiety and depression. <br>
    To get a better understanding of my target audience I sent a survey throughout the school. 
</p>
<p class="heading">Wearable (Fitbit):</p>
<p>Fitbit is a wearable that tracks heart rate to gather data relating to cardiovascular fitness as well as using an accelerometer to track steps taken for a similar purpose. It also has software to help users
     understand their sleep quality. <br><br>
     <a href="https://www.jameco.com/Jameco/workshop/Howitworks/how-it-works-fitbit.html#:~:text=The%20Fitbit%20uses%20a%203,device%20that%20measures%20acceleration%20forces.">www.jameco.com</a><br><br>
     I chose to include the heart rate tracking but found no use for the accelerometer and discovered that the sleep aid technology would not be feasible to test.
</p>
<p class="heading">Mental Health Apps (Headspace) </p>
<p>Headspace: Meditation app for stress reduction, user-friendly with accessible programs. Personalized features include progress tracking, meditation goals, and tailored recommendations.<br><br>
    <a href="https://www.forbes.com/health/mind/headspace-review/">www.forbes.com</a><br><br>
    I incorporated elements of simplistic design and tailoring towards userâ€™s needs but chose to not include meditation as the focus of my device. 
</p>
<p class="heading">Simple Games (Tetris)</p>
<p>
    Classic puzzle game: arrange falling shapes for complete lines, testing organization skills. Simple gameplay enhances spatial reasoning and quick decision-making. Tetris combines challenge and enjoyment with 
    deceptive simplicity. <br><br>
    <a href="https://www.nationalworld.com/culture/gaming/tetris-game-mental-health-anxiety-tetris-effect-wellbeing-4144843">www.nationalworld.com </a><br><br>
    I decided to build the premise of my device around this idea of a game that is used to improve mental health through repetition and simple gameplay and develop reaction time and decision-making skills.  
</p>
<br>
<p>These concepts will allow me to meet the basic and advanced requirements of the brief. </p><br>
<p class="heading">Market Research</p>
<p>
    To further my understanding of the user's end requirements I carried out market research using Microsoft Forms.<br>
    Below you can see some of the results of the research that was sent out to multiple year groups in my school.
</p>

<p>Due to the user's younger age and high reaction time, I concluded that a memory game similar to Simon Says would be the best approach to designing this model.</p>
